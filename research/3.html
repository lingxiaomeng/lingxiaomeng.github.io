<p>Fuzzy rule-based systems have been successfully applied to many real-world applications. The main advantage of fuzzy rule-based systems is their linguistic
    interpretability, where a set of fuzzy IF-THEN rules is used to describe the input-output relationship. One of the popular applications of fuzzy rule-based
    systems is the fuzzy rule-based classification system. The design of compact, interpretable and high-performance fuzzy rule-based classification system
    remains a challenging research topic. This is because there exists a trade-off between the accuracy and complexity of the fuzzy rule-based classifier. </p>

<p>模糊系统已在现实生活的各种场景中广泛使用。模糊系统的优势在于它能使用具有逻辑语义的模糊规则来描述输入与输出之间的关系。</p>

<p>基于模糊规则的分类器是模糊系统的一个重要应用。由于模糊规则分类器的复杂度与其准确率之间存在冲突，即我们很难得到一个低复杂度且高准确率的模糊规则分类器。因此，设计一种简洁、易懂且高性能的模糊规则分类器是一个极具挑战性的研究课题。</p>
