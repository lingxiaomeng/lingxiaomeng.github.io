                    Message to Chinese Students
                    In 2017, I came to SUSTech to help Prof. Xin Yao to create one of the best CS departments in the
                    world. In SUSTech, I am always trying to increase the international presence of the SUSTech CS
                    Department. I am also always trying to help highly-motivated young researchers and students to be
                    internationally well-known researchers in the field of Computational Intelligence using my knowledge
                    and experiences.</p>

                <p>The main research field of our research group is multi-objective evolutionary computation. In principle,
                    evolutionary computation can be applied to all optimization and learning problems such as the optimization of
                    high-speed train shape design (Shinkansen), the optimization of airplane shape design, and the structure
                    optimization of deep learning neural networks. Multi-objective evolutionary computation is a class of optimization
                    algorithms designed for the handling of multiple conflicting objectives (e.g., the performance maximization and
                    the cost minimization when you choose a computer). For more details, please <a href="{{"/research" | relative_url }}">click</a>.</p>
